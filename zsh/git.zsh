# I want a function that:
# - Stages all changed files
# - Commits files with the given message
# - If no message is given, use `git commit --amend` to squash the changes into the last commit
# So, it automatically minimizes commits for me -- I only created new ones when I have something to say

# I need some stuff to visualize my repos better
# - Something for logs and history
# - Something for branches
# - Something for diffs
